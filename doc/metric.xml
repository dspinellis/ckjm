The metrics <em>ckjm</em> will calculate and display for
each class are the following.
<dl>
<dt>WMC - Weighted methods per class</dt><dd>
A class's <em>weighted methods per class</em> WMC
metric is simply the sum of the complexities of its methods.
As a measure of complexity we can use the cyclomatic complexity,
or we can abritrarily assign a complexity value of 1 to each method.
The <em>ckjm</em> program assigns a complexity value of 1 to each method,
and therefore the value of the WMC is equal to the number of methods
in the class.
</dd><dt>DIT - Depth of Inheritance Tree</dt><dd>
The <em>depth of inheritance tree</em> (DIT) metric provides
for each class a measure of the inheritance levels from the object
hierarchy top.
In Java where all classes inherit Object the minimum value
of DIT is 1.
</dd><dt>NOC - Number of Children</dt><dd>
A class's <em>number of children</em> (NOC)
metric simply
measures the number of immediate descendants of the class.
</dd><dt>CBO - Coupling between object classes</dt><dd>
The <em>coupling between object classes</em> (CBO)
metric represents the number of classes coupled to a given
class (efferent couplings, Ce).
This coupling can occur through method calls,
field accesses, inheritance, arguments, return types,
and exceptions.
</dd><dt>RFC - Response for a Class</dt><dd>
The metric called the <em>response for a class</em> (RFC)
measures the number of different
methods that can be executed when an object of that
class receives a message (when a method is invoked
for that object).
Ideally, we would want to find for each method
of the class, the methods that class will call,
and repeat this for each called method,
calculating what is called the <em>transitive closure</em>
of the method's call graph.
This process can however be both expensive and quite
inaccurate.
In <em>ckjm</em>, we calculate a rough
approximation to the response set
by simply inspecting method calls within the class's
method bodies.
This simplification was also used in the 1994 Chidamber and Kemerer
description of the metrics.
</dd><dt>LCOM - Lack of cohesion in methods</dt><dd>
A class's <em>lack of cohesion in methods</em> (LCOM)
metric counts the sets of methods in a class that are not related
through the sharing of some of the class's fields.
The original definition of this metric
(which is the one used in <em>ckjm</em>)
considers all pairs of a class's methods.
In some of these pairs both methods access at
least one common field of the class, while in
other pairs the two methods to not share any
common field accesses.
The lack of cohesion in methods is then calculated
by subtracting from the number of method pairs
that don't share a field access the number of
method pairs that do.
Note that subsequent definitions
of this metric used as a measurement basis the number
of disjoint graph components of the class's methods.
Others modified the definition of connectedness to
include calls between the methods of the class.
The program <em>ckjm</em> follows the original (1994) definition
by Chidamber and Kemerer.
</dd><dt>Ca - Afferent couplings</dt><dd>
A class's afferent couplings is a measure of how many other classes
use the specific class.
Ca is calculated using the same definition as that used for
calculating CBO (Ce).
</dd><dt>NPM - Number of Public Methods</dt><dd>
The NPM metric simply counts all the methods in a class that
are declared as public.
It can be used to measure the size of an API provided by a package.
